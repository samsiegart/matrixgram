### FAQ


_"Do you always look at it encoded?"_

Well you have to. The image translators work for the construct program.
But there’s way too much information to decode the Matrix.
You get used to it. I…I don’t even see the code.
All I see is blonde, brunette, red-head. Hey, you uh… want a drink?

_"Why the fuck would I ever want to use this?"_

Good question.

### Setup

First make sure opencv is installed on your machine:
  - OS X: ![This tutorial was helpful for me](http://www.mobileway.net/2015/02/14/install-opencv-for-python-on-mac-os-x/)
  - Linux: You're using Linux, you should be able to figure it out yourself

```
$ python matrix.py
```
